# Associated with MDC STEM Research Institute - “Calibration and Programming of The Guardian Rover Robotnik Robots.” 

Contributed to the development and integration of electrical systems for an autonomous ground vehicle based on the Robotnik platform (Robotnik Automation Guardian):

- Embedded and Electrical Systems Team Lead (e.g., circuits, wiring, schematics, PixHawk controller)
- Collaborated with interdisciplinary teams to integrate hardware, troubleshoot system communication (e.g., roscore conflicts), and ensure real-time operation.
- Configured and calibrated autonomous tank using ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04; tuned velocity controllers and sensor parameters for accurate motion response.
- Documented calibration process and system architecture for future engineering cohorts.
